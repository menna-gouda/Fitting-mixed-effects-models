# Antibody Titer Data Modelling and Assessment

# About
This repository contains code for generating synthetic antibody titer data, fitting a simple linear model to it, and assessing whether the model accurately predicts the true parameters used for generating the data. Additionally, a mixed effects model with fixed individual effects across strains is applied to the data.

# Installation
To replicate the experiments and analyze the results, follow these steps:

# Clone Repository: Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
1. Install Dependencies: Ensure you have all necessary dependencies installed, including statistical modeling libraries for the programming language used (e.g., R, Python).
2. Setup Environment: Set up your development environment to accommodate the project requirements and configuration.
3. Run Experiments: Execute the provided scripts or code snippets to generate synthetic data, fit models, and assess predictions.

# Usage
This project facilitates the assessment of antibody titer data modeling using simple linear regression and mixed effects modeling techniques. It aims to evaluate the performance of these models in predicting true parameters and capturing individual effects across strains.

# Potential Applications
1. Immunology research and vaccine development
2. Statistical modeling and inference in biological data analysis
3. Quality control and validation in antibody titer assays
4. Comparative analysis of modeling approaches in biomedical research

# Features
1. Generation of synthetic antibody titer data
2. Fitting of simple linear regression model to the data
3. Application of mixed effects modeling with fixed individual effects across strains
